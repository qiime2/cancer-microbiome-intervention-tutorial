# Hematopoietic cell transplantation data

This folder contains experiments with hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) microbiome data reused from [Liao et al (2021) _Compilation of longitudinal microbiota data and hospitalome from hematopoietic cell transplantation patients_](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-021-00860-8) ({cite:t}`liao-hct-2021`). We thank the authors for their considerable efforts to make this valuable data set accessible to the cancer microbiome research community. Any work that uses this data should cite {cite:t}`liao-hct-2021` **and** the original studies (which are all cited in {cite:t}`liao-hct-2021`).
