QIIME 2 View is a web-based viewer for `.qza` and `.qzv` files. If you've never visited QIIME 2 View, take a minute to [go to the website](https://view.qiime2.org) now. This site allows for you to view QIIME 2 results on computers that don't have QIIME 2 installed on them, and there are a few examples that you can look at in the gallery on that page. I use QIIME 2 View daily, for a few different situations. First, if I'm running analyses on a cluster computer than doesn't provide a graphical interface, it's a convenient way to view those results without having to load QIIME 2 on another computer. If I have a copy of a `.qza` or `.qzv` file on my local computer (e.g., if I copied it over from the cluster) I can navigate to QIIME 2 View, and drag-and-drop the file on the QIIME 2 View page to look at it. Another scenario where this is helpful is if when I'm sharing interactive QIIME 2 results with someone who doesn't have QIIME 2 installed, for example a collaborator. I can send them `.qzv` files by email (or use the Dropbox sharing option on QIIME 2 View), and they can load and interact with the results on their computer.

When you're using QIIME 2 View, your data isn't uploaded to a server. Rather the website acts as an application launcher that allows you to view local files. This means that you don't need to be concerned about data privacy issues with QIIME 2 View - the data never leaves your computer.
