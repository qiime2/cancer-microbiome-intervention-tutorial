  abstract = "The impact of the gut microbiota in human health is affected by
              several factors including its composition, drug administrations,
              therapeutic interventions and underlying diseases. Unfortunately,
              many human microbiota datasets available publicly were collected
              to study the impact of single variables, and typically consist of
              outpatients in cross-sectional studies, have small sample numbers
              and/or lack metadata to account for confounders. These
              limitations can complicate reusing the data for questions outside
              their original focus. Here, we provide comprehensive longitudinal
              patient dataset that overcomes those limitations: a collection of
              fecal microbiota compositions (>10,000 microbiota samples from
              >1,000 patients) and a rich description of the ``hospitalome''
              experienced by the hosts, i.e., their drug exposures and other
              metadata from patients with cancer, hospitalized to receive
              allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) at a
              large cancer center in the United States. We present five

              and lack of standardization limits cross-study comparisons. To
              address these challenges, we developed RESCRIPt, a Python 3
              software package and QIIME 2 plugin for reproducible generation
              and management of reference sequence taxonomy databases,
              including dedicated functions that streamline creating databases

              date, the most commonly used method for dimensionality reduction
              in the microbiome is calculation of between-sample microbial
              differences (beta diversity), followed by principal-coordinate
              analysis (PCoA). Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection
